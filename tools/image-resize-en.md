# image-resize.online

## Introduction

Last month, I developed my first web application in life —— [image resize online](https://www.image-resize.online)!

It's a pure front-end image processing website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Without the need for back-end support, it can help you complete the following tasks:
- Image compression
- Image cropping
- Image rotation
- Customizing image size

What's special is that it supports batch processing of multiple images. Even better, you can perform multiple operations on the same image. For example, you can crop it first, click "apply" to save it, and then continue to resize it... It's completely up to you!

All the processing is done in the browser, which means your images won't be uploaded to any server, ensuring privacy and security. The processed images can be directly downloaded to your local device, which is convenient and fast.

I've put a lot of thought into it, hoping to make this tool easy to use and fast, and intuitively meet users' needs. Of course, I've also done a lot of tests to ensure that the processing results are accurate and reliable. In terms of interface design, I've chosen a minimalist style, with no ads and no redundant buttons, just hoping that everyone can focus on the image processing itself.

If you encounter any problems during use or have any suggestions, you are welcome to raise issues on GitHub. This project will be continuously updated and maintained, and more practical functions may be added in the future.

I hope this little tool can bring convenience and happiness to everyone, and I also look forward to it becoming a frequently used tool in your browser bookmarks!
